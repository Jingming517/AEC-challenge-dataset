# Materials to generate Gold standard stimuli database


## Generate
use `azure_tts_create_msgs.py` to create the audio clip given your customized test. Information on how to setup your 
system can be found in [3].

## For ACR test
All files start with `ACR_*`. They are created based on description in section 6.3.8 of the ITU-T P.808 [1] and [2].
The audio clips were created using Bing Speech API.
